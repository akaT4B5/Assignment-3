**Project Overview**
Digital Gym Buddy is a full-stack web application designed to help users track and manage their fitness progress. It allows users to log detailed workout sessions, view visual exercise guides, and access pre-made workout templates.
The application implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to maintain a persistent history of their training.

**Features**
Create: Log new workout sessions with specific details (Date, Focus).
Dynamic Inputs: The "Add Session" form dynamically toggles input fields based on the exercise type:
Strength: Tracks Sets, Reps, and Weight.
Cardio: Tracks Distance and Duration.
Read: View a chronological list of past workouts with an expandable "View Details" dropdown.
Update: Edit existing sessions to correct mistakes or update metrics.
Delete: Remove unwanted sessions (includes a deletion confirmation alert).
Resources: Access a library of "Easy Exercises" with visual diagrams and "Workout Templates" for routine ideas.

**Technologies Used**
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud), Mongoose (ODM)
Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) Templating
Deployment: Render

**Styling & Design**
Bootstrap 5: Used for the core grid system, responsive behaviors, and base component styling.
Custom CSS: A custom stylesheet (public/style.css) was created to implement the specific "Pink/Red Panda" branding, custom card animations, rounded UI elements, and the "Sticky Footer" layout.
Note: As per assignment requirements, custom CSS was prioritized to ensure the app looks unique and professional.

**Credits & References**
Workout Diagrams: Images for the "Easy Exercises" page were sourced from Darebee and WorkoutBox for educational demonstration.
Bootstrap: Used via CDN for layout structure.
